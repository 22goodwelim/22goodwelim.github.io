			<h1>Our Family</h1>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
					<div class="mission">
						<p class="about">Hi! We're the Goodwin Family. Joe and Melissa met in their early 20s in Southern Utah where they were students at nearby Universities. They shared a love for travel and had already had unique opportunities to travel. Joe lived in Japan for 2 years serving a mission for the church of jesus christ of latter day saints. Melissa toured Europe and parts of Russia and Ukraine while finishing her Associates Degree, then a year later, stayed with the family of her pen pal in Southern France for a month. Their life together has taken them many places through the U.S. and they are now proud parents of two daughters. They’ve run a number of successful businesses together, weathered the upheaval of 9/11, the economic crash of 2008 (and are now navigating the world-wide Corona Virus). After being in the same place for the last 15 years, the whole family decided that they are ready for a big change and challenge. After talking out several ideas, sailing is the one that made sense, so here they go!</p>

			<h2 class="center">Melissa</h2>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
					<div class="mission">
						<p class="about">Melissa is the lead experimenter of the family – outside and inside. she is always game to try something new and doesn’t worry about ideas not working out. She says, ‘You have to get through all the no’s, (or all the things that don’t work) before you can get to the yes.’ ‘Taster-testers’ and experiments with plants in the garden are not unusual. She studied Mathematics in college and it remains her favorite school subject. Melissa also likes playing the piano, being outside, reading and digging in the vegetable garden or flower beds. One of Melissa’s favorite memories as a young girl was wandering in tide pools with her parents hunting for crabs, watching the anemones collapse at her touch then reopen, and beachcombing for shells. The ocean has always drawn her with its salty breezes and lapping water, but the visits have been few. She is looking forward to this grand adventure though she has no sailing experience. She is looking forward to seeing more of the world in her own time, staying a little longer in places that peak her interest, savoring all that those places offer with no specific deadlines. It is also important to her to show her girls that there is more than the traditional way to live, that they can do anything they set their minds to and that they have all they need to solve any problem inside themselves.</p>

			<h2 class="left dad">Joe</h2>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
					<div class="mission">
						<p class="about">Joe has always wanted to travel the world. He earned his Pilot’s license at the young age of 16.
						After his mission, he continued his training and began flying for the airlines. With the tragedy of 9/11, the future that he and Melissa had planned for no longer existed. After a lot of thought, they decided to change their life plan and move back to Southern Utah. Together they have been able to be successful in many parts of small business and have welcomed two amazing daughters. He has explored various parts of the Southwest on his mountain bike, loves to tease, and when there is a subject that interests him, he devotes himself to study it. He enjoys playing Parcheesi with his daughters and tinkering with the yard’s sprinklers. One thing that has never changed for joe is his desire to travel. Due to various personal experiences over the last few years, and Melissa decided it was time to put work on hold and have a family adventure. One thing that he is certain of is that there will always be more time for work, but time for being active, exploring and experiencing new things with his family seems to have an expiration date.</p>

					<div class="mission">
						<p class="about">Hi! I'm Eliza, and I created this Website. I am 15 years old and I enjoy a wide variety of hobbies including science, reading, art, and music. I have loved science since 6th grade and I was even a part of a competitive science program. My favorite books include <i>The Evolution for Calpurnia Tate</i>, <i>Tutles All the Way Down</i>, <i>Rocket Boys</i>, and <i>Counting by Sevens.</i> Reading has always been a big part of my life and I have loved it since I can remember. Art is also a big part of my life. I like to paint mostly, but I also enjoy sketching and sculpting. Before we left for Turkey I played piano. I had taken lessons for two years before stopping to play the alto saxophone in 6th and 7th grade. After 7th grade, I quit to continue playing the piano. I hope to learn many new and exciting things while I traverse with my family and can't wait to see what we discover.</p>
