				<p class="blog1">June 15, 2019<br>Well, it’s been years in the making.  And we finally decided, that our lifestyle change would be to….Living on a Boat! 

For the last few years Joe and I have been considering what to do to provide a wider world experience for our girls.  We began to take Trips for Christmas which has been fantastic and we will continue this tradition.  Our first Christmas trip was to Washington DC in December 2017.  We all enjoyed seeing new things and when joe and I said that we had decided to go to Japan in Fall 2018, the girls were on board and it was another great trip.  Then to the Bahamas in 2019.  Each trip was more reason to continue to explore the world.  We considered living in a foreign country for a few years, maybe moving around the US staying in different cities for a couple of months at a time, but when Joe suggested buying a boat to live on as we sailed the world, that was the one that made complete sense.  Which might seem crazy, but it makes perfect sense to us.</p>
