			<div class="blog"><h3 class="heading">Scuba Diving</h3>
				<p class="blog1">July 10, 2019<br>We’ve starting to gather information about sailing, started looking at boats and learning a little about how living on a boat will be different than living on land.  It looks like there is a LOT to learn but seems pretty doable.  As a whole, we don’t have a ton of stuff relative to those around us.  So it won’t be too drastic.  It will be a matter of a couple of yard sales and paring down our clothes to a minimal amount that we’ll need.  We will purchase all the cooking equipment we need once we own the boat.  Well, we may take our rice maker.  And my favorite red knife.  And the salad shooter.

Tomorrow we have our first classroom session for our scuba certification.  We’ve read the first section of our books sitting around the table and took all the quizzes there.  Apparently class will be pretty small.  I’m curious to see what it is like.  Joe isn’t very comfortable with the water and wanted to do something to face that fear.  He landed on scuba diving and we decided to do that as a family, especially as it is something we can do on our boat.  Eliza’s not too keen on the idea, but she’s part of the family, so she’s in.</p>
