			<h1>Why We Care</h1>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper care">
			<div class="mission"><p>We have traveled to many islands and have seen the destruction that the human race has caused throughout the world. Before we traveled to these amazing places, we didn't put any effort into saving our oceans and our wildlife. We used plastic without a second thought and never gave a second glance at what it was doing to our oceans. When we went to Eleuthera in the summer of 2019, we came face to face with the filth of the human race. There were beautiful beaches that strewn with garbage. Plastic bottle, sunglasses, shoes, toothbrushes, plastic pieces, grocery bags, gallon jugs, and just about anything else you could imagine. We were utterly horrified at what we were seeing. When we went scuba diving over Christmas in 2019, we saw a beautiful gray and white fish almost eat a piece of a plastic garbage bag. While we were scuba diving we also saw dead and dying coral. We saw coral that was a brilliant red right next to coral that was gray and decaying. Conservation is not something that we can ignore any longer. Our oceans are dying and without the help of us as humans, we may be close to destroying our oceans to the point of no return.</p></div><img class="pollution" src="images/pollution.jpg" alt="pollution"></div>

			<h2 class="apple">Pollution</h2>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
			<br>
			<div class="mission"><p>Pollution is one of the most destructive forces that we have created. <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-long-does-it-take-garbage-to-decompose-2878033">According to The Balance</a>, it takes 10-20 years just for a grocery bag to decompose, and it takes plastic bottles 450 years.  Robber boot soles take 50-80 years. Batteries take 100 years. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.complastic-in-ocean-outweighs-fish-evidence-report-2017-1">According to Business Insider</a>, there is about 165 million tons of plastic in the ocean and by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. There is so much garbage in the ocean, that sometimes debris formes giant garbage patches. The largest includes 1.8 trillion pieces of trash and covers an area twice the size of Texa. Pollution affects humans more than we think. Chemicals such as mercury, oil, lead, pesticides and other heavy metals can contaminate our food chain by affecting the marine life involved. If humans are exposed to these toxic chemicals for long periods of time, this can result in dangerous health problems.

			<h2 class="banana">Dead Coral</h2>
			<br>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
			<div class="mission"><p>Coral reefs only cover about .0025% of the oceanic flood, but then generate half of Earth's oxygen and absorb nearly one-third of the carbon dioxide generated from burning fossil fuels. What many people don't know is that the coral you are used to seeing, are actually animals. When we destroy coral reefs, we are killing an entire ecosystem. Many species of fish depend exclusively on the reef and when we kill the coral, we are simultaneously killing all the fish that live off the coral. When we destroy coral we are not killing just a rock patch. Coral only grows .3 to 2 centimeters per year more massive coral and up to 10 centimeters per year for branching coral. According to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_reefs.html">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, it can take up to 10,000 years for a coral reef to form from a group of larvae. We can destroy 10,000 years of growth in just a few years.</p></div><img class="coral" src="images/coral.jpg" alt="coral"></div>

			<h2 class="orange">Over Fishing</h2>
			<br>
			<div class="flexmission wrapper">
			<div class="mission"><p>Overfishing is the act of catching too many fish at once, so the breeding population becomes too depleted to recover. According to the <a href="https://www.edf.org/oceans/overfishing-most-serious-threat-our-oceans">Environental Defense Fund</a>, of all the threats facing the oceans today, overfishing takes the greatest toll on seal life and people. Overfishing endangers ecosystems and 3 billion people who rely on seafood as a key source of food. Without sustainable management, fisheries will collapse and we will be in the midst of a food crisis. According to <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/overfishing">World Wildlife Fund</a>, the number of overfished stocks globally ahs tripled in half a century, and today, one-third of the world's assessed fisheries are currently pushed beyond their biological limits. More than 90 species of fish in European water alone are threatened with extinction, and 40% facing extinction due to overfishing. Without proper guidelines and laws set in place, and we continue at the present rate of overfishing, we will run out of seafood by 2050.
