				<p class="blog1">September 20th, 2019<br>Well, we’ve made it through all our Scuba classes and 2 pool dives.  We have 2 lake dives left but it is starting to get cooler and we are running out of time.  We started out in the pool at the Washington Rec Center.  For the first ‘pool dive’, we had to swim 1000 meters – which was not difficult for me, float on our backs for 3 minutes (which is easier now that I have a few extra pounds), and learn our gear – how to put it on and use it and then worked on underwater buoyancy.  After the first dive, I came home thinking ‘I can honestly say I am not a scuba diving fan.  I don’t like trying to breath only through my mouth, my mask hurts, and those tanks are heavy.  Thank goodness the side is just a stroke away so I can get my bearings again and take a couple regular breaths.  I like swimming and snorkeling – but not so much scuba diving.’  Of course, I kept a smile on my face and didn’t tell anyone my thoughts.  In my life, I have learned that usually the first experience is not enough to make a final judgement – especially when it is something totally new.
The next week’s pool dive was a lot better. We got new masks and that made a big comfortable difference, and it was helpful that I had a little idea of what I was supposed to do.  Buoyancy is still hard for me and Adelaide gets cold too soon.  Eliza and Joe seem to be doing really well.

We’ll be doing our open water dives at Sand Hollow Reservoir in Hurricane soon, but school has started and Eliza is busy on weekends with tennis and debate tournaments, so we’ll see how soon we can get that done.

Still looking at boats, found a few selling sites, and a couple of You-Tubers that are doing something similar to what we want to do.  We will have to figure out how to tie a bunch of knots and learn the boat lingo enough to not have to think about it each time – starboard, aft, port, stern, reefing, etc.  I’m letting joe do most of the research for now.  He’s so good at it and seems to really enjoy it.

As a side note – with people we meet through work, our conviction that this is something we need to do and we need to do it soon is just being strengthened.  People work their whole lives just to get too old and too sick to enjoy the life they’ve been planning on.  Or they work so hard they never enjoy their family while they’re home then never get that chance again.  We’ll be able to work when we’re older.  This is a chance we want to take now, while we are still in good health and relatively young, and can really experience all the things that this change will bring to us.</p>
