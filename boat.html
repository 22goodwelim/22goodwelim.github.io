	<p class="boatdescript wrapper">The Lagoon 39 is an excellent sailboat, mixing performance and living comfort on board. Lagoon has successfully managed to combine seaworthiness, comfort and beautiful volume. This is something we as a family really liked when looking at various sailboats. The very high sails and steering station on the fly bridge is one of the major features that contributes to the sailing comfort of the Lagoon 39. With its self tacking jib, a more balanced sail plan and gull-wing bridge deck, maneuvers are easy to perform and navigations are smooth. The large forward triangle offers a greater choice of downwind sails for better performance. The simple and efficient deck layout enables to control the main maneuvers directly from the helm station. On deck, you can safely circulate from the aft section of the boat to its forward part thanks to the wide side decks. Inside, everything is well-thought-out and optimised, creating a family friendly enviornment for onboard living. Cabins are spacious and the living space is friendly and functional. The Lagoon 39 comes in varius versions, but we selected the owners version. This gives Mom and Dad an entire hull all to themselves. This is very important when you are living full time onboard a sailboat. Our family spent a lot of time looking at differnt boats and decided the Lagoon 39 is the perfect boat to carry our family from one adventure to another.</p>
